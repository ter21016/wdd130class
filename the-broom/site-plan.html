        <br>American workers are among the most productive in the entire world and have been for decades. Dual-income families are a fixture and so are work weeks and commutes that stretch beyond 40 hours into nights and weekends. Kids have homework, practice, rehearsals, sports meets, and a variety of other activities that require many parents to spend even more time out of the house.

        Working most commonly on a weekly or every other week schedule, Molly Maid gives busy individuals and families clean, comfortable homes to return to and enjoy—homes cleaned according to their individual wishes and services backed by a 24-hour satisfaction guarantee.

          FAQs
          How much does a house cleaning service cost with The Broom?
          Because we customize our cleaning services, the cost to clean your home will depend on the services you choose, the size of your home, its condition, and other factors. No matter your cleaning needs, count on us for a plan that fits your schedule and budget.
          
          What should I do before The Broom arrives?
          To ensure you get the most from your cleaning team, please clear floors of toys, clothes, and other items. If you have pets, please locate them in a comfortable area of your home while we clean. Please make sure to let your house cleaners know if your cleaning needs have changed prior to arrival.
          
          How often can you provide service?
          The Broom is happy to provide service once a week, every other week, or at any frequency that meets your needs. Remember, there are no contracts with Molly Maid, so you can always adjust the frequency and services provided. No matter how often you need your home cleaned, we have a plan.
          
          What types of cleaning products does The Broom use?
          Because we care about making your home as clean and healthful as possible, our team only uses cleaning products that meet our standards for safety and effectiveness. Many inexpensive cleaners are diluted and leave residue behind, while the concentrated cleaners we use are much more effective. We’re also happy to provide eco-friendly cleaning solutions for each of our home cleaning services.
