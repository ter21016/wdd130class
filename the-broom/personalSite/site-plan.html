        <br>American workers are among the most productive in the entire world and have been for decades. Dual-income families are a fixture and so are work weeks and commutes that stretch beyond 40 hours into nights and weekends. Kids have homework, practice, rehearsals, sports meets, and a variety of other activities that require many parents to spend even more time out of the house.

        Working most commonly on a weekly or every other week schedule, Molly Maid gives busy individuals and families clean, comfortable homes to return to and enjoy—homes cleaned according to their individual wishes and services backed by a 24-hour satisfaction guarantee.
