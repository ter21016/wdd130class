            <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
            <p>American workers are among the most productive in the entire world and have been for decades. Dual-income families are a fixture and so are work weeks and commutes that stretch beyond 40 hours into nights and weekends. Kids have homework, practice, rehearsals, sports meets, and a variety of other activities that require many parents to spend even more time out of the house.
             Working most commonly on a weekly or every other week schedule, Molly Maid gives busy individuals and families clean, comfortable homes to return to and enjoyâ€”homes cleaned according to their individual wishes and services backed by a 24-hour satisfaction guarantee.
