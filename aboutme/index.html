    <p>I am originally from Peru and currently reside in Washington State with four children.
        I love hiking and exploring the beautiful views that Washington has to offer.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of Church of Jesus Christ of latter Day Saints since 1992 and my favorite 
     scripture is 2 Nephi 32:9</p>
        I also have a favorite quote from Elder Uchdort "Healing comes when we move away from the darkness and walk towards the light"
    <p>My mayor is applied technology, I am very excited to start this semester and learn from each of you.</p>
